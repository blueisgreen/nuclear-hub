# Plans for the Nuclear Exchange

## Discussion Forums

Discussion forum featuring leading advocates for nuclear energy. A safe space for supporters of nuclear and the nuclear curious (people who want to learn).

This is our attempt to replace Reddit. We will be experimenting with a variation on the well-worn threaded discussion concept.

### [What Say You](what-say-you).

A different approach to discussion - sort of a hybrid between threads and substack. Each response can start a branch of a longer discussion. Any point can have multiple branches.

### Nuclear Learning Lab

Lessons on everything you need to know to really understand nuclear energy and the way it is used to solve problems, like generating electricity and producing clean water and sterilization and producing medicinal isotopes and so on.

### Nuclear Simulator

Drive your own nuclear power plant. We start with basics. Modules get more intricate as you advance through learning levels. It's all about hands-on learning -- with zero risk when things go wrong.

### Fun and Games

[Word searches](word-search) and fun ways to get familiar with nuclear energy.
