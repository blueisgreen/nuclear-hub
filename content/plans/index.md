# The Nuclear Hub - Grand Plans

This is the official record of what is to become. This is a labor of love, so let's be patient while we create something great. Also, this plan is bound to move, perhaps to Notion so that it's more accessible to our community of contributors. Stay tuned...

Here are the big features of the Nuclear Hub that we are building.

## Member Profiles

This is your place to show your credentials. Who are you? What do you do? Why are you a nuclear energy advocate? And anything else that tells the world about you.

## Directory

We will put together a multi-purpose directory feature profiles or members, companies, organizations, websites, and causes related to the nuclear industry. The idea is to make the whole thing searchable so that it's easy to find others.

For starters, the directory will focus on members, since a growing number of member profiles will be available as people join the platform.

## Discussion Forums

Discussion forum featuring leading advocates for nuclear energy. A safe space for supporters of nuclear and the nuclear curious (people who want to learn).

This is our attempt to replace Reddit, where trolls run free. We will be experimenting with a variation on the well-worn threaded discussion concept.

### [What Say You](what-say-you).

A different approach to discussion - sort of a hybrid between threads and substack. Each response can start a branch of a longer discussion. Any point can have multiple branches.

Moderated just enough to discourage trolling while supporting freedom of opinion.

## Projects

Just a thought. The Hub could offer some basic project management, starting with a mission statement (a.k.a. stated purpose) and adding members to a project team. We can develop this idea a bit more while other features are being built.

## What else?

No, that's not a feature. It's a call for ideas. What would make this a must-join place for nuclear advocates?

# Zanzibar's World of Nuclear Energy

Zanzibar's World is a companion site focused on helping people learn anything and everything about nuclear energy. Advocates are welcome to join the effort to provide this knowledge.

## Nuclear Learning Lab

Lessons on everything you need to know to really understand nuclear energy and the way it is used to solve problems, like

- generating electricity,
- heating buildings,
- sterilizing medical instruments,
- producing clean water, medicinal isotopes, hydrogen, and more.

### Nuclear Simulator

Drive your own nuclear power plant. We start with basics. Modules get more intricate as you advance through learning levels. It's all about hands-on learning -- with zero risk when things go wrong.

### Fun and Games

- [Word searches](word-search) and fun ways to get familiar with nuclear energy.
- [Creative corner](creative-corner) where people share creative writing and digital art related to the nuclear energy.
